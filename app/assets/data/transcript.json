As a result, medical devices are becoming more portable and accessible for everyone. For example, look at dialysis. Dialysis removes impurities from blood when a patient's kidneys are unable to perform this critical, life-sustaining function.</p><p>Would you prefer travelling to a facility multiple times every week for treatment or have treatment performed in your home?</p><p>Now, would you prefer dialysis treatment in a hospital or at home? </p><p>Would you prefer needles or a surgically implanted catheter? </p><p>Today, critical, life sustaining treatments like dialysis are moving to the home environment. Rather than traveling to a hospital or clinic three to four times a week for hemodialysis, where a needle and tubing connect the patient to a machine that cleans and returns the blood to the patient, many people are now able to have dialysis performed in the comfort of their own homes. This is called peritoneal dialysis.</p>"

More advanced versions of these devices transmit vital sign data from a patient's home to clinicians, enabling real-time monitoring of a patient's health.</p><p>More advanced treatment devices, like dialysis machines, sleep apnea machines, infusion pumps, and oxygen concentrators are available in the home environment.</p><p>All of these devices utilize some kind of sensor. For example, blood pressure monitors use pressure sensors. Peritoneal dialysis machines use pressure sensors and temperature sensors. Infusion pumps use force sensors.</p><p>Honeywell is poised to take advantage of increased sales volume in the sensor market from the growth in home-based medical devices.</p>"

Note that these aren't the only areas we can sell into, but these are the focus areas.Â We do sell into some devices that are outside of the eight target/focus medical applications.</p><p>Select each medical application shown on the screen to learn more about it.</p><p>The respiratory medical application represents a set of medical equipment responsible for uninterrupted respiration, that is, inhale of Oxygen and exhale of Carbon Dioxide from the human body. Sensors are used to detect any interruptions in the airflow to and from the body.</p><p>Some examples of medical equipment in this category include anesthesia delivery systems, ventilators, spirometers to measure lung function, and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, or CPAP machines for sleep apnea.</p><p>Diagnostic and analytical equipment is used to diagnose diseases, make treatment decisions, and to monitor patients. </p><p>Some examples of medical equipment in this category include blood analyzers and chemistry analyzers.</p><p>Hospital hardware facilitates smooth hospital operations and patient care.</p><p>Some examples of medical equipment in this category include sterilizers, blood storage refrigerators, autoclaves, incubators, hospital beds, medication dispensing cabinets etc.</p><p>Dental equipment uses sensors for position control of dental chairs and pressure monitoring of fluid or air.</p><p>Some examples of medical equipment in this category include dental imaging systems, dental chairs, and pressure-operated dental instruments including drills, water sprays, and air blasters. </p><p>Surgical instruments use sensors to regulate the movement of air, gas, or fluids to maintain precise levels of pressure and force in surgical instruments.</p><p>Some examples of medical equipment in this category include orthopedic bone drills, endoscopes, and surgical fluid management systems.</p><p>Patient monitoring equipment is used in operating rooms, emergency rooms, intensive care units, and patients' homes to monitor and display vital signs of patients' health conditions, such as blood pressure, blood glucose, respiration, temperature etc. This data enables doctors and medical practitioners to make treatment decisions.</p><p>Some examples of medical equipment in this category include patient monitoring, blood pressure and blood glucose monitoring, respiratory monitoring, and temperature monitoring.</p><p>Infusion pumps are used to deliver fluids, such as nutrients or medications, into a patient's body accurately and in a controlled manner. Sensors are used to monitor for occlusion or blockage preventing the delivery of fluids to the patient.</p><p>Some examples of medical equipment in this category include high-volume infusion pumps, insulin pumps, and syringe pumps.</p>"
