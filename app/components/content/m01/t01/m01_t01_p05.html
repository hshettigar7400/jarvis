It is the digitization and interconnectivity of medical devices that makes gathering medical data for current and future analysis an effortless activity. This is called the Internet of Things, or IOT. The proliferation of medical devices with embedded sensors, combined with existing connectivity infrastructure, has fostered a dramatic increase in health-related applications and real-time data monitoring. This, in turn, fuels the development of additional connected devices.Honeywell has various sensor offerings, many with industry-leading, small-size, and power-consumption specifications, making them ideally suited to mobile and connected devices. Each sensor performs a unique function in medical equipment aligned to different medical applications."+ "IOT is evolving every day. It has a lot of potential for more technological advancement and provides ample possibilities " + " andopportunities to explore. Nobody can anticipate what’s in store next."
