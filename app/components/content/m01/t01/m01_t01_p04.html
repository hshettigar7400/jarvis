var transcript = "The annual Consumer Electronic Show (CES), organized by Consumer Technology Association (CTA), held in 2016 showcased how the medical device industry is now dominated by the health and fitness market. Smaller, portable, personalized devices have shifted industry focus from the clinic to the home. For instance, devices like glucometers, scales, and heart rate and blood pressure monitors can be easily operated, managed, and handled by people in the home. More advanced versionsof these devices transmit vital sign data from a patient’s home to clinicians, enabling real-time monitoring of a patient’s health. There are wearable and talking medical devices with push buttons to send out alerts for emergency medical help, connect to expert to take charge of the situation, set reminders for medication doses, check blood pressure, or recommend exercise at a scheduled time. Most of these devices utilize some kind of sensor. For example, blood pressure monitors use pressure" + "sensors. Peritoneal dialysis machines use pressure sensors, heaters, and temperature sensors."As small, portable devices leave medical facilities to function in homes, offices, vehicles, and on wearers, the demand for direct connections to health experts grows. Consumers expect more and more from these devices, so the demand for sensors that can detect information and coordinate data transmission will grow, too. Honeywell is poised to take advantage of increased sales volume in the sensor market."
